# Project-1
The task involved creating two SQL tables: one with data on wages and food prices for the Czech Republic over a defined period, and the other with supplementary data such as GDP and population for other European countries. The main objective was to collect and prepare datasets on food prices, income, and GDP for the Czech Republic to answer five research questions related to the food prices and salaries.

## The research questions included:

-- Question 1: Do wages increase across all industries over the years, or do they decrease in some sectors?

-- Question 2: How much milk (in liters) and bread (in kilograms) can be bought in the first and last comparable periods in the available data on prices and wages?

-- Question 3: Which food category has the slowest price increase (the lowest year-over-year percentage increase)?

-- Question 4: Has there been a year in which the year-over-year increase in food prices was significantly higher than wage growth (greater than 10%)?

-- Question 5: Does the level of GDP affect changes in wages and food prices? In other words, if GDP increases significantly in one year, will this result in a more significant rise in food prices or wages in the same or the following year?
